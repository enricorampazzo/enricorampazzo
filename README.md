## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Enrico, I am an experienced backend engineer branching out to ML and freelancing :)

My main area of interest is local LLMs, either on device or on premise: I am currently learning RAG, and especially Graph RAG because I have quite a bit of experience with Neo4J and Cypher.

Also, because I already have some experience with Docker Compose I want to upgrade to Kubernetes, wish me luck ðŸ˜…

Last but not least, since I bought a laptop with an NPU I am trying to learn as much as possible about NPUs and how to leverage them: you can see some benchmarks [here](https://medium.com/@Enrico_Rampazzo/what-i-learned-from-running-llama-3-locally-on-an-ultralight-laptop-without-a-gpu-3dd4236eb547)
